Classifying Cultures with Bibliometric Methods

This project uses the bibliometrix in R to classify scientific cultures that use testosterone in their research. Given that testosterone research is a sizable literature (about 60,000 articles), it is tough to know where to start reading. This project outlines how I broke down the literature into 25 epistemic cultures and conducted bibliometric and scientometric analyses on each domain. This provides one strategy for science & technology studies scholars to simplify large scale projects, hone their research goals, and to understand how scientific objects are enacted differently across a number of epistemic cultures.
